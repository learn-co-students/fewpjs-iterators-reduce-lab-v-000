// Code your solution here

const batteryBatches = [4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 6, 5];
const totalBatteries = batteryBatches.reduce((total, batch) => total + batch, 0);

// reducer
// batteries
//   ✓ should have a `totalBatteries` variable
//   ✓ should have a number as a result
//   ✓ should have made the sum of all the assembled batteries
